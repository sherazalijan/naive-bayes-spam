# 📨 Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes

A beginner-friendly machine learning project that detects whether an SMS message is **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using the Naive Bayes algorithm.  
Built with love, learning, and a clean 98% accuracy.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This project reads a dataset of SMS messages and trains a classifier to recognize spam.  
It uses text vectorization + a Naive Bayes model to make predictions, with performance measured on unseen data.

You can input your own messages and check if they’re spam — coming soon with a web version via Streamlit!

## 🎯 Accuracy

- **Accuracy:** `98%` on the test set  
- Evaluated using a split of real-world labeled messages

This means the model correctly classifies 98 out of every 100 messages.
